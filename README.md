# Mini Data Analysis (Karanvir Singh, STAT545A WT1 2022)

This repository contains the source code and knitted outputs (as .md files) for Milestones 1 and 2 of the Mini Data Analysis projects. This is a project that is part of the curriculum of STAT545A at UBC. Here, I explored relationships between the frequency, types and values of building permits in the City of Vancouver between 2017 and 2020. The output folder contains the outputted files from Milestone 2.

Outputs for Milestone 1 and 2 are found in their respective folders. The .md files in each folder can be opened directly on github. Here you will see the questions and corresponding answers and plots generated. The data used in this project is available in the datateachr package (the `building permits` dataset).

The repo can be cloned using RStudio (or other version control software).
